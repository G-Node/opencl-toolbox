% opencl class creates a basic interface to the OpenCL device + platform
% This class is responsible for setting up the device/platform to use,
% for adding and building the OpenCL source files, and for forcing a 
% "wait" to occur to allow all operations pending on the GPGPU to finish.
%
% Note: You may only create one instance of this class. Multiple instances
% of this class share the same device state. So, don't attempt to utilize
% multiple instances of this class. It doesn't provide any value.
% 
% All cleanup and device release calls are handled automatically when you
% quit MATLAB or call "clear all"

% Example usage:
%   ocl = opencl();  % Fetch a list of available platforms and devices
%
%   disp(ocl);  % Inspect the platform and device you want to use
%               % All platforms available are in the member attribute
%               % .platforms )
%               
%   disp(ocl.platforms(1) );
%
%   % Within each platform, there there is a list of devices associated with
%   % the platform. You can view this in the .devices attribute for each
%   % platform
%   
%   disp(ocl.platforms(1).devices);
%   disp(ocl.platforms(1).devices(1));
%
%   % Assuming we want to pick platform 1 and device 1 (as viewed above):
%
%   platform = 1; 
%   device = 1;
%   ocl.initialize(platform, device);
%
%   % Now let's load the kernel cl/simple_add.cl
%   ocl.addfile('cl/simple_add.cl');
%  
%   % You can add additional files you want to use
%   % ocl.addfile('cl/another_file.cl');
%   % ocl.addfile('cl/another_file2.cl');
%
%   ocl.build();   % Now let's build our kernel and send to the GPU device

        % FAQ: 
        % Q: What is a platform? 
        % A: A platform is simply the library that implements the 
        % OpenCL functionality. It is installed when you install the
        % OpenCL device driver from the vendor. Each platform can
        % communicate with one or more devices. For example, common
        % platforms are:
        %   - the AMD/ATI Stream platform (which can talk to CPUs and ATI
        %     GPGPUs)
        %   - the NVIDIA platform (which can talk with NVIDIA GPGPUs)
        %   - the Intel platform (which can talk to CPUs for now)
        %
        % Each platform is associated with one or more devices. The device
        % is the physical hardware that contains the GPU/CPU computing device
        % we want to use.
        %

        % initialize(obj, PLATFORM, DEVICES)
        % 
        % Initialize OpenCL interface to use the specified platform and 
        % devices. 
        %
        % PLATFORM is the index of the platform in obj.platforms to
        % use (where first index is 1). If unspecified, 1 is the default 
        % value and the first platform is used.
        %
        % DEVICES is the indices of the devices in the platform to use 
        % (where first index is 1). If unspecified, the first device on
        % the selected PLATFORM is used. 
        %
    	% Note: Calling this function wipes out the previous state of the
	    % interface mex and resets the GPGPU state.
